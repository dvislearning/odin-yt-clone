# YouTube Clone

A design clone of a YouTube watch page, as an exercise in html/css, as well as
embedding videos from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/embedding-images-and-video?ref=lnav) full stack web development curriculum.

Each element of a the page was faithfully replicated including all suggested video 
thumbnails, and YouTube header buttons and meta buttons.  Buttons have been 
stubbed out as links, however, and javacript components were omitted.  

The project attempts to deplicate how a watch page appears as of March 15, 2018.  The actual
page may change in the future due to redesign by the YouTube team. 

Featuring the iconic scene "chocolate factory" from I Love Lucy!
